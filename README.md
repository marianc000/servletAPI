# How Servlet 4.0 and 5.0 are even more convenient than the perfect 3.1
Useful, potentially useful, not useful and harmful features of the modern Servlet API.

Sample code for my post https://marian-caikovski.medium.com/how-servlet-4-0-and-5-0-are-even-more-convenient-than-the-perfect-3-1-782b87aa21b7 comparing Servlet API 3.1 to 4.0 and 5.0. What are the most useful features for anyone?
